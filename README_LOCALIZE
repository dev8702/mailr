Here we will describe how to make translations for Mailr

1. Supose we will translate Mailr in French
2. In locale directory create subirectory fr_FR
3. In newly created directory fr_FR create subdirectory LC_MESSAGES

result:
  |
  |_ locale
     |
     |- bg_BG
     |
     |- fr_FR
        |
	|- LC_MESSAGES
4. Run script for extracting strings from rails application to po files
	
script/localize

5. Run PoEdit (http://poedit.sourceforge.net/)

6. Make translations to your newlly created file (locale/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po)

7. Compile po file to mo file using PoEdit


NOTE: Switching of locales is made in ApplicationController localize filter - by default mailr looks for HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE of remote browser and switches translation
